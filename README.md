#Harding Computer Science Connect

If you've ever gotten a job based on the recommendation of a friend, you know the value of connections. The goal of Harding CS Connect is to help graduates from the Harding Computer Science program get in touch with other alumni working in different types of jobs all over the country. Obviously having a connection isn't a guarantee you'll get hired, but sometimes the hardest part is just knowing where to start.

This simple web app is meant to connect graduates, students and instructors from the [*Harding University Computer Science department*](http://www.harding.edu/comp), and is developed by Brent Pendergraft in collaboration with Harding University Professor [*Dr. Dana Steil*] (http://www.harding.edu/dsteil/).
